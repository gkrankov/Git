# Google Maps Starred Places Cleanup Script

This Python script allows you to automate the process of removing permanently closed businesses and restaurants from your starred list in Google Maps. Please note that this script is provided as an example and may not work with the current state of Google Maps services, as Google does not provide a public API for managing starred places.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure that you have the following:

- Python installed on your system (Python 3.x recommended).

- Required Python libraries. You can install them using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install requests

A Google Maps account with starred places.

## Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/google-maps-cleanup.git
cd google-maps-cleanup

Edit the script Google-Maps-Cleaner.py and replace the following placeholders with your information:

YOUR_API_KEY: If required, provide your Google Maps API key.
YOUR_USERNAME: Your Google Maps username.

Run the script:
python Google-Maps-Cleaner.py

The script will attempt to retrieve your starred places from Google Maps and remove permanently closed businesses/restaurants based on your criteria. Make sure to review the code and customize the criteria as needed.
